# Lobsang
Most up to date code running on Lobsang. Modifications have been made since Pi Wars 2015.

This is the code that runs on my Raspberry Pi & RasPiO Duino powered smallish two wheeled robot. Lobsang.py is a library including all the communication etc to the other parts of the robot *except* the OLED. Oled.py is the library for that, which I wrote myself. It's tailored for my needs.
