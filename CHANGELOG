26th Jun 2016:
Began changelog for Lobsang code.
Previously, started work on Lobsang in general again. There was a large break since last December. Greatly improved obstacle.py, which attempts to avoid obstacles and drive forward as much as it can. This now works relatively well.
Began work on neural network- using PyBrain library. Very tentative steps right now. nndist.py learns to stay ~50cm from obstacle using ultrasonic. Neural network is trained to drive forward or back depending on the distance in cm that the ultrasonic reads.
Created menu.py- clone of piwars_menu.py but it only includes non piwars-specific programs. This is now the standard menu that loads when the Pi boots.
